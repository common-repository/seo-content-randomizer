Write multiple versions of a page’s content that will be randomly selected each time the page is loaded. This also works with images and keywords.


== Description ==
The SEO Content Randomizer lets you write multiple versions of a post/page's content and will then randomly select one version each time the page is loaded. This also works with images and keywords. You can add multiple images or even multiple categories of images that you can add to your content with the use of shortcodes. When the page gets rendered it will randomly select one image per shortcode. The same goes for keywords, where you can define singular and plural keywords and insert a keyword shortcode into your content that will be replaced with a randomly selected one upon loading the page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Will my original content get deleted, once I turn a page into a randomizer page? =

No. The plugin doesn't delete any of your data. If you turn a randomizer page back into a normal page, your original content, including the default content editor will appear again. You can even bring the default editor back, on randomizer pages, by going to "SEO Content Randomizer" in your WordPress Admin Dashboard and deactivating the setting "Hide Default Content Editor".

= Why is the default content editor hidden on randomizer pages and how do I get it back? =

Since the SEO Content Randomizer replaces your single editor with multiple content block editors, there is really no need to show the default editor, so we hide it by default. However, no content gets deleted and you can bring the default editor back by going to "SEO Content Randomizer" in your WordPress Admin Dashboard and deactivating the setting "Hide Default Content Editor".
